     <center><h1>8 Easy Steps To Help You Achieve Your Health Goals</h1>

 <section id="sample">
<h2>1. Be realistic.</h2>
The best intentions run amok when people attempt to make unrealistic lifestyle changes. They tend to be wishes more than goals. One of my most important goals as a psychologist is to help people separate fantasy from reality. I want people to deal with reality. Take a hard look at your resolution in the light of day to make sure it is something you can achieve. Unattainable goals are left unfulfilled and lead to disappointment.
<br>
<h2>2. Establish step-wise objectives.</h2>
Pursue your larger, overall goal in incremental steps. If your goal is to lose 50 pounds, start small. Instead of overhauling your entire diet, replace one guilty pleasure — such as cookies or ice cream — with something healthier that you enjoy, such as your favorite piece of fruit. I know exercise is good for mental health, but I never tell patients to start exercising 30 minutes a day, seven days a week. Instead, I tell them to start doing something three days a week, even if it is just walking the dog around the block. Do what you can; you can always up the ante as your progress toward your overall goal.
<br>
<h2>3. Be persistent.</h2>
Go easy on yourself. If you stray off course, don’t give up. Just because you succumbed to a bowl of ice cream on Saturday night, does not mean you have to resume making ice cream a regular part of your diet. Consider your relapse a learning experience. Try to figure out why you fell back into a bad habit, and what you can do to prevent it from happening again. Nobody’s perfect.
<br>
<h2>4. Reward success.</h2>
When you reach a goal, do something you enjoy. See a movie or buy a new outfit — whatever makes you feel good.
<br>
<h2>5. Seek support.</h2>
Find others who share your goals and pursue them together. Like-minded individuals are easy to find this time of year — in exercise classes, support groups and smoking cessation programs.
<br>
<h2>6. Take one day at a time.</h2>
Follow the practice of 12-step programs and stay in the present. “Forever” is a long time; thinking too far into the future can make chasing a goal seem like a marathon more than a fun run.
<br>
<h2>7. Focus on one behavior at a time.</h2>
People trying to exercise, lose weight and stop smoking all at the same time are destined for failure. Pick a “target” behavior that is important to you and that you have wanted to change for a long time. Make one goal and go after it.
<br>
<h2>8. Keep a diary or journal.</h2>
Writing things down helps you state your goals and track your progress. It’s an expression of your commitment and a good way to look back and see how far you have come, which can motivate you to continue.
