        <div> Python is an interpreted, high-level and
     general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code 
     readability with its notable use of significant indentation.<p class="sample1">Hello World</p> 
     Its language construct and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
      write clear, logical code for 
      small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
       It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly,
        procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described 
        as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

    HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then
     using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser 
     reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
     Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, 
    about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML documents.
