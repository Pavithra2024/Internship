       <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
            practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
             Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
              The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools 
              and techniques used to create the front end of a website change 
              constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of
               how the field is developing.
               The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site 
               they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.
                This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices
                 with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
                  consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform)
                and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
